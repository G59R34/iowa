## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### **1. Google Maps API Key**
You'll need a Google Maps API key for the map to work:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable the Maps JavaScript API
4. Create credentials (API Key)
5. Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in `altima-sim.html`

### **2. Run the Game**
1. Open `altima-sim.html` in your browser
2. Click "START DRIVING" to begin
3. Drive aggressively and try to get the highest score!

### **3. Alternative Setup (No API Key)**
If you don't want to set up Google Maps, you can modify the game to work without it:

```javascript
// In altima-sim.js, comment out the initMap() call in startGame()
// this.initMap(); // Comment this line
```

## üèÜ Scoring Strategy

### **High Score Tips**
1. **Use Boost** - Hold Shift while driving for extra speed and points
2. **Cut Off Cars** - Get close to AI cars to cut them off (+10 points)
3. **Near Misses** - Get close but don't crash (+15 points)
4. **Horn Constantly** - Spam the horn for extra points
5. **High Speed** - Stay above 80 mph for continuous points
6. **Chaos Mode** - Reach 500+ points for visual effects

### **Avoiding Game Over**
- Don't crash into other cars (game over)
- Use R to reset position if you get stuck
- Keep moving to avoid being hit

## üé® Customization

### **Modifying Car Appearance**
Edit the CSS in `altima-sim.css`:
```css
.car-front, .car-middle, .car-back {
    /* Change car colors */
    background: linear-gradient(45deg, #your-color, #your-color);
}
```
